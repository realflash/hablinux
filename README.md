# HAB Linux
A live USB distribution intended for HAB builders and trackers

## About
HAB Linux is a Linux distribution built specifically for HABbers - people who build, release and track high altitude balloons. It is an Xubuntu installation that is customised with softwre tools used by HAbbers. The release version is a disk image that you write to a USB memory stick, and then boot your computer from. Instructions for its build are provided in case you should want to build it yourself.
